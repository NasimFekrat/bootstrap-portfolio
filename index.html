                        With a robust blend of technical acumen and diverse professional experience, I have carved a
                        niche as a proficient Full Stack Web Developer. My journey in technology began with a Bachelor
                        of Science in Computer Engineering from Azad University, Central Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran,
                        culminating in a pivotal final project on the Scrutiny and Implementation of Wireless
                        Communication in Smart House. This project not only laid the foundation for my technical prowess
                        but also ignited a passion for creating innovative solutions.
                        <br />
                        Currently, I am leveraging my full spectrum of skills as a Full Stack Web Developer at Crosslinx
                        Transit Solution in Toronto, ON. Since August 2023, I have been pivotal in developing a
                        comprehensive web application for asset tracking, data storage, and reporting. My work,
                        characterized by a blend of PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and the innovative use of Power BI
                        for data visualization, has significantly enhanced operational efficiencies and informed
                        decision-making processes. My commitment to implementing security best practices and my
                        proactive approach to maintaining the application highlight my dedication to excellence and
                        continuous improvement.
                        <br />
                        My technical skills are comprehensive, encompassing coding, server and database management,
                        version control, and deployment tools. I excel in responsive and mobile-first design, Bootstrap,
                        React, Node.js, RESTful API design and development, and am proficient in cloud platforms like
                        Cloudways, as well as in tools such as Docker and Heroku. My expertise in MS Office, advanced
                        Excel, and Power BI further enhances my ability to deliver insightful and impactful solutions.
                        <br />
                        Beyond my technical capabilities, I am a collaborator at heart, skilled in working within teams
                        and utilizing platforms like Git and GitHub for version control and project management. My
                        career trajectory is a testament to my adaptability, technical proficiency, and unwavering
                        commitment to advancing the field of web development. I am not just a developer; I am a
                        visionary, continually seeking to expand my knowledge and embrace emerging technologies to stay
                        at the cutting edge of the industry.
